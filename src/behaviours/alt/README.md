In this folder there are alternative behaviours that correct the following
problem in our statement:

If an alumn can't go to the group that has been assigned to it, following the
statement, we should start asking for changes, and reject all incoming change
requests. **This has an obvious flaw**, when no alumn can go to its group
(everyone would start asking to everyone, but everyone rejects everything).

In this alternative behaviours, the possible changes are always accepted and
sent to the teacher, and the teacher accepts every change that hasn't "expired"
due to a previous change.

This behaviours allow the system to make more parallel changes, expiring the
invalid changes in the teacher.

I'm not allowed to use them though, given a conversation with the teacher, which
considered that this was "centralysing the algorithm", despite of all the
benefits I exposed above.
